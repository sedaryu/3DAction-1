Hello,


thank you for buying this m1911 Prefab.





How to set it up ?


I guess, you want to use the gun in you character.

Example of the m1911 setup with an arm:



- Place the m1911 in the scene next to the hand and bring it in the right position.



- After that drag the whole Glock prefab into your character model.



- I suggest to put the " Weapon_body " into the bone_rig, where the action is like the hand, because you can better work with it then



- So now go on the character origin bone_rig and create an animation.





 Here is a you tube video how to set a rigged asset store gun up :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1au9iWYUJI&feature=youtu.be 



  The m1911 model has this follow materials:



  Weapon_main = The main mesh.
aim_points = if you aim with the gun, yo usee points, the material is for the points(As example to make them glowing)


 Bullet_in_magazine = The Bulletcase in the gun, as exmaple, if the magazine is empty, you don`t want to have a bullet in the magazine, so with a extra separate material 
                      can you disappear the bulletcase.
